This is a static HTML email page I built for my company.

There is no CSS, JavaScript involved since it is going to deploy out a of a blast email database system my company uses.
However, I was in charge of the layout and I didn't really like any of the database's layouts, so I ended up designing my own. 
The images are hosted by the datatabse and not from my own files.
